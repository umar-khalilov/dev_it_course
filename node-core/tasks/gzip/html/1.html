            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son

                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated

                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.

        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.

    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.

        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished

        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.

        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                novels to come.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                "People, Places, and Things--Volume I". King's stories included
                "Hotel at the End of the Road", "I've Got to Get Away!", "The

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                and his mother was Ruth Pillsbury King.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son

                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated

                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.

        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.

    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.

        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished

        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.

        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                novels to come.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                "People, Places, and Things--Volume I". King's stories included
                "Hotel at the End of the Road", "I've Got to Get Away!", "The

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                and his mother was Ruth Pillsbury King.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son

                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated

                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.

        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.

    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.

        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished

        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.

        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                novels to come.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                "People, Places, and Things--Volume I". King's stories included
                "Hotel at the End of the Road", "I've Got to Get Away!", "The

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                and his mother was Ruth Pillsbury King.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son

                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated

                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.

                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.

        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.

    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.

        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished

        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.

        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.

        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

                novels to come.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.

            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son
                of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated
                when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford,
                Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children
                back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury,
                had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by
                her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support.
                After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the
                kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High
                School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of
                Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE
                MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a
                member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement
                on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the
                University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and
                qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination
                immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood
                pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-info">
                He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the
                stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where
                they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at
                an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an
                occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor")
        to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his
        marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these
        were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other
        anthologies.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes
        at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in
        the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories
        and to work on novels.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for
        publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new
        editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
        provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family
        to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting
        a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen
        wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then
        Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the
        garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age
        of 59.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings
        left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less
        than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
        Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in
        the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished
        writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
        was also written in Bridgton.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in
        England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December,
        purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
        summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen
        could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The
        Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
        Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell
        house as a summer home.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of
        the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip,
        and four grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200
        pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a
        frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
        between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring
        training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons.
        He has worn glasses since he was a child.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing
        cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit
        part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also
        appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his
        directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie
        Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students
        and contribute to many other local and national charities.
    </p>
    <p class="bg-info">
        Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for
        Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National
        Medal of Arts.
